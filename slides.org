  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  Not covering Integrant change.
  #+END_NOTES

* New event system overview
  
  - Events are data
  - Dispatched via core.async
  - Handlers are pure functions (mostly)
  - Handlers return
    - Transactions
    - Events
    - AI notifications

* Old event handler

* Router

  - Calls handlers
  - Executes transactions
  - Sends AI notifications

  TODO: add code

* New event system advantages 
  
  - Validation
  - Testing
  - Logging
  - Error handling

* Original AI system

  TODO: add sequence diagram

* Original AI system
  
  - Direct game DB interaction
    - Requires running in the same process
    - Incompatible with new event system
  - No support for multiple AIs

* New AI system

  TODO: add sequence diagram

* New AI system

  - No direct game DB interaction
  - Game process sends notifications to AIs
  - AIs send events to game process
  - AIs maintain local copy of game state
  - Supports any number of players
  - Supports AI vs AI

* Other action format uses

  - Game logging and replay
  - Network games

* Optimizing Reagent and Posh

  - Queries logic often overlaps
    - Combine queries
    - Use Reagent to create views
  - Data changes at different rates

* Optimization examples

* What I've learned

* Future plans

* Making an AI
